\[company] is a power cord manufacturer and distributer, known for having the largest 
U.S. in-stock inventory of power cords and adapters. The legacy e-commerce website, 
built in 1997, had not grown technologically with \[company]'s users. Mobile users were 
not considered in marketing and design decisions. There was a potential to capture 
these users through making the web experience accessible to them. Responsive design 
however was not an easy sell to management. Analytics was the push needed to get 
the pitch approved.
