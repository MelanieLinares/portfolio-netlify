        fancy new Chemex but have no clue how to use it? Don't worry, we’re here
        to help. You can schedule a custom 1-on-1 consultation with our baristas

        We believe that good coffee has the power to bring people together.
        That’s why we decided to turn a corner of our shop into a cozy meeting
        space where you can hang out with fellow coffee lovers and learn about
        coffee making techniques. All of the artwork on display there is for
        sale. The full price you pay goes to the artist.

    production, roasting and brewing seriously and we’re glad to pass that
    knowledge to anyone. This is an edit via identity...

\[company] is a power cord manufacturer and distributer, known for having the largest 
U.S. in-stock inventory of power cords and adapters. The legacy e-commerce website, 
built in 1997, had not grown technologically with \[company]'s users. Mobile users were 
not considered in marketing and design decisions. There was a potential to capture 
these users through making the web experience accessible to them. Responsive design 
however was not an easy sell to management. Analytics was the push needed to get 
the pitch approved.
